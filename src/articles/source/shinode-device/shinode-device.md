The device-side code for integrating IoT sensor and control devices with the Shineponics platform. It's all built into a lovely C++ class that took me a good lil' while to figure out. In the end I wrote the class logic in TypeScript first, then used ChatGPT to convert it into Arduino C++ to get started. Of course the code was not immediately working but it was a great boost!

I actually made a short vlog series of the development process of this which can be [viewed here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1dWu9TH9l0&list=PL_rri5TzIGYh3aXR0-sAqJy18Jl9vOiQf).

For examples of implementation please check out the source code on GitHub.
