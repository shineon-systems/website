Welcome to 2023. The planet is heating up like a kid with measles, the human world just got rocked by COVID and the rich continue to get richer while most people’s dreams of financial freedom quiver like a flame in a rainstorm.

The truth is that our current social structure does not serve the masses. It puts the power to divide profits and make decisions in the hands of a wealthy minory while the hands of the many generate the bulk of said profit. In a world increasingly run by money this leaves people stuck. Stuck working for often questionable organisations in order to spend money on more questionable organisations. The hamster wheels spins while the owning-class extract value. Is there any liberation from this?

Yes. This is where food sovereignty comes in. As humans we have fundamental needs: sustenance, protection, community, etc. The unfortunate truth is that corporations have managed to take almost total control of these needs. Need sustenance? Buy it. Need protection? Buy it. Need community? Buy it. Food sovereignty means giving people access to food without making them pay for it. Make food a community-enriching experience outside of capitalism, outside of economies of scale and outside of colonial wealth extraction.

Sounds nice right? But you probably don’t believe it’s possible. As politics and capitalism have come closer together people and their freedoms have been dragged apart. Divisive technology, under-funded public services and an economy of greenwashing have created confused and disillusioned public. It does not always have to be this way. Shineponics is a project set out to prove that owning our future by taking back control of our food is not just possible, it's achievable today! It simply requires sustainable technology and resources combined with community effort and care, that’s it. The way to a technological and socially-empowered age has already been paved. Just look at the internet, an amazing resource full of collective knowledge and experience that is shared by masses and simply distributed over standardised data transfer protocols. People can be extremely gracious but most of our lifes are governed those blinded by the dollar signs in their eyes. 

Of course, food sovereignty is just one part of a much larger societal movement. But food is fundamental, so seems like the natural place to start. Not only do we need to eat it to survive but food is part of our community and identity, which only makes it more powerful to own for ourselves. This is the beginning of taking back control and showing destructive forces that we do not need them if they don’t serve us and our environment. 

I believe we all want a better future, one that supports community and creative freedom. The time is now. This is a deeply important pursuit that requires knowledge, technology and collective effort. It is all pointless without action and that is what Shineponics is, action.
