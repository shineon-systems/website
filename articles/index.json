This code is then used when devices with matching IDs\\nto the defined system POST their state data to the cloud.</p>\\n<p>The Deno KV database was instrumental in allowing this to work in the\\nDeno Deploy serverless environment. Each POST request from a device\\nupdates an object stored in Deno KV.

Additionally, devices will need to request with a specific\\ntoken generated by the backend for that device but this is not yet\\nimplemented. These measures are to keep all networking secure as any\\nunintended access to a real-world control system could lead to\\ndevastating consequences.</p>\\n<p>This technology is being used to control and log the <a\\nhref=\\\"/farms\\\">balcony smart farm</a> data right now!

The planet is heating up like a kid with a fever, we\\nall just got rocked by COVID and civil unrest swells as inflation and\\nwealth-divisions grow. All while most people‚Äôs dreams of financial\\nfreedom quiver like a flame in a rainstorm‚Ä¶ not the prettiest picture is\\nit?</p>\\n<p>It‚Äôs evident that our current system is struggling to serve\\ncommunities or the environment. It puts the power to divide profits and\\nmake decisions in the hands of a minory while the hands of many generate\\nsaid profit. In a world increasingly run by money this leaves people\\nstuck. Stuck working for often questionable organisations in order to\\nspend all of their money on more questionable organisations. The hamster\\nwheels spins while the owning-class extract value. Is there any\\nliberation from this?</p>\\n<p>This is where food sovereignty comes in. As humans we have\\nfundamental needs: sustenance, protection, community, etc. The\\nunfortunate truth is that corporations have managed to take almost total\\ncontrol of these needs. Need sustenance? Buy it. Need protection? Buy\\nit. Need community? Buy it. It is important to note that this is not\\npurely a fault of capitalism, I believe this is also the result of a\\ndecline in communal identity and action in modern society. Food\\nsovereignty means giving people access to food without making them pay\\nfor it. Make food a community-enriching experience outside of\\ncapitalism, outside of economies of scale and outside of colonial wealth\\nextraction.</p>\\n<p>Sounds nice right? But you probably don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs possible. As\\npolitics and capitalism have come closer together people and their\\nfreedoms have been dragged apart. Divisive technology, under-funded\\npublic services and an economy of greenwashing have resulted in a\\nconfused and disillusioned public. It does not always have to be this\\nway. Shineponics is a project set out to prove that owning our future by\\ntaking back control of our food is not just possible, it‚Äôs achievable\\nwherever you are today! It simply requires sustainable technology and\\nresources combined with community effort and care, that‚Äôs it. The way to\\na technological and socially-empowered age has already been paved. Just\\nlook at the internet, an accessible resource full of collective\\nknowledge, shared by masses and distributed over standardised data\\ntransfer protocols. People can be extremely gracious but most of our\\nlives are governed those blinded by the dollar signs in their eyes.</p>\\n<p>Of course, food sovereignty is just one part of a much larger\\nsocietal movement. But food is fundamental, so seems like the natural\\nplace to start. Not only do we need to eat it to survive but food is\\npart of our community and identity, which only makes it more powerful to\\nown for ourselves. This is the beginning of taking back control and\\nshowing destructive forces that we do not need them if they don‚Äôt serve\\nus and our environment.</p>\\n<p>We all want a better future. This is a deeply important pursuit that\\nrequires action and that is what Shineponics is, action. Also it‚Äôs\\npretty fun to write code that helps plants grow in cities. Just picture\\nthat, a city full of urban farms and forests that support local\\ncommunities. Epic.</p>\\n<p>If you would like to see Shineponics in action then check out our\\nongoing smart farm projects at <a\\nhref=\\\"https://shineponics.org/farms\\\">shineponics.org/farms</a>.</p>\\n<p>Please do get in touch via the email below if you are interested in\\ncontinuing this conversation.</p>\\n<p>Many thanks and stay strong!</p>\\n<p>Seb</p>\\n\"",

But I do want to\\nhighlight the various degress of success that many organisations have\\nreached with what is called the ‚Äúopen-core‚Äù model.</p>\\n<p>The ‚Äúopen-core‚Äù model essentially means that a business‚Äô core value\\nproposition does not come from licensing a carefully-protected product\\nbut from the expertise in supporting other organisations using a freely\\navailable one. The tech world is full of companies like this: GitLab,\\nDocker, Elastic, Redis, just to name a few. They create free and\\nopen-source technology and then host it on managed cloud infrastructure\\nfor paying customers and provide support and training consultancy. This\\ngives people the choice to use the technology for free, but spend time\\nlearning and managing it, or to pay for a simpler, managed experience.\\nIt is this business model that we are planning to implement around our\\nopen-source technologies.</p>\\n<p>This sounds pretty great but it can be taken a step further. These\\ntech companies are (mostly) still under the control of shareholders and\\ndirectors, giving decision-making power that affects vast swathes of\\npeople to just a few. We then have to hope that they remain virtuous and\\ngracious in their actions. What happens when a large institution wants\\nto buy the technology? Typically, shareholders are in it for profit and\\nso they jump at the opportunity to sell. Ideally, people using a\\ntechnology should have a say in its direction and how it can be used for\\nprofit.</p>\\n<p>For these reasons commercialisation of Shineponics technology is\\nbeing very carefully considered. Companies registered in Germany for\\nexample must have a certain percentage of board members be workers, I\\nhave a friend implementing a setup like this for a community-land trust.\\nI am also very intrigued by the idea of a co-operative platform for many\\nof the aforementioned reasons but there is still much to learn. I hope\\nyou are interested in following along with the journey.</p>\\n\"",

Is it anywhere near being actually\\nsustainable? Here‚Äôs how we strive to do better than ‚Äúgreen‚Äù and truly\\npioneer sustainable tech business and social change.\\n</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p><strong>Warning: This article gets technical!</strong></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"green-tech\\\">‚ÄúGreen‚Äù tech</h2>\\n<p>First of all, no tech is green. Some unfortunate truths of the world\\nwe live are that most raw materials are unsustainably extracted from\\nforeign lands, labour is usually paid the bare minimum and even if your\\nenergy supplier is ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, the wider economy in which you both operate\\nis not.</p>\\n<p>As a technophile I am obviously not going to campaign for the\\nabandonment of all tech but it is important to realise that, at present,\\nwe are currently building on borrowed time. This is a big part of the\\nmotivation behind Shineponics!</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"cloud\\\">Cloud</h2>\\n<p>Now, accepting that we can only make ‚Äúbetter‚Äù decisions, let‚Äôs\\nexplore some of the decisions made at Shineponics. First of all,\\nShineponics uses Deno Deploy for cloud infrastructure. Deno Deploy is\\nthe commercial cloud infrastructure built around the Deno JavaScript\\nengine. Both the Deno engine and the JavaScript language itself are\\nopen-source technologies, wahoo!</p>\\n<p>Deno Deploy supports many standardised web platform APIs and\\nencourages their use, this is another step towards community ownership\\nthat I greatly appreciate and it reduces vendor lock-in, a tactic used\\nby organisations like Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. Deno Deploy also uses\\nGoogle Cloud Platform under-the-hood, which in 2021 powered its\\ndatacenters with 61% renewable energy, a step in the right\\ndirection.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"data\\\">Data</h2>\\n<p>Another hot topic in the tech world is data protection. Platforms\\nlike Facebook and Google capitalised off of user data for far too long\\nbefore regulation started to come into play. Most users still don‚Äôt have\\nan understanding of what they are giving away when signing up to\\nplatforms and telling them to read pages of ‚Äúterms and conditions‚Äù is\\nsimply not an ethical solution.</p>\\n<p>Shineponics understands what Ben Parker meant when he said ‚Äúwith\\ngreat power, comes great responsibility‚Äù. As developers of communal\\ntechnology we have a responsibility to protect the users that allow us\\nto do what we love. You may notice that you have not clicked a cookie\\nnotice on this site. Why? Because we do not use cookies! We do\\nanonymously track things like request times, rough geographic area,\\npreferred language etc as a means to improve our services but we don‚Äôt\\npretend we need your personal information to do that.</p>\\n<p>We also build our platforms to support user-owned data first and\\ncloud-stored data second. A Shineponics application will only store data\\nlocally within your browser by default, giving you complete control of\\nwhat we know about you. Want to clear the data? Just clear the browser\\nstorage. If you want to persist your data on the cloud and share it\\nacross multiple devices you can, but that is done at your\\ndiscretion.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"energy\\\">Energy</h2>\\n<p>A secondary benefit to our local-data-first approach is that our\\nsoftware uses less energy than other similar software because we simply\\ninteract with less stuff. Without as many database read and writes we\\ntransmit less. On top of this we run all of our web applications on the\\nserverless edge with Deno Deploy. This means we never maintain unused\\nserver infrastructure, we spin up code when its needed and let it die\\nwhen its not. Hooray for energy efficient cloud services!</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"hardware\\\">Hardware</h2>\\n<p>Shineponics hardware is a work in progress. We are currently\\nexperimenting with ESP8266 boards and peripherals as they appear to be\\nthe best community-backed and open-source solution for low-cost IoT\\ndevices. However there is much more to investigate here. We also can‚Äôt\\navoid the fact that the raw materials used in hardware boards are likely\\nnot sustainably sourced. This will therefore continue to be ‚Äúnon-green‚Äù\\nuntil locally-produced hardware is available. This may not be possible\\nyet but is certainly on the roadmap. I hope for now that the decisions\\nmade in developing our software provide assurance that our hardware\\nchoices will be made with as much consideration towards our communities\\nand the environment as possible.</p>\\n<p>Stay tuned for the next steps in our ‚Äúbetter‚Äù direction. Goodbye for\\nnow!</p>\\n\""
